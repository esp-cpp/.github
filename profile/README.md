## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to ESP-CPP!

This is an open-source community-driven organization for reusable c++ components developed for espressif micorcontrollers.

Feel free to take a look around our repositories. We've got:
* `esp-cpp/espp` which is the main set of reusable components
* `esp-cpp/template` which is a template repository for an application which uses `espp` components
* And we have various example and fun projects such as `esp-box-emu` and `software-defined-haptics` to show off various things you can do with espp :)

Feel free to join our Discord and chat with us or ask questions!
