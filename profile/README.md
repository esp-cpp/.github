## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to ESP-CPP!

This is an open-source community-driven organization for reusable c++ components developed for espressif micorcontrollers.

Feel free to take a look around our repositories. We've got:
* [esp-cpp/espp](https://github.com/esp-cpp/espp) which is the main set of reusable components
* [esp-cpp/template](https://github.com/esp-cpp/template) which is a template repository for an application which uses `espp` components
* And we have various example and fun projects such as [esp-cpp/esp-box-emu](https://github.com/esp-cpp/esp-box-emu) and [esp-cpp/software-defined-haptics](https://github.com/esp-cpp/software-defined-haptics) to show off various things you can do with espp :)

Feel free to join our Discord and chat with us or ask questions!
